## Findings

### CRITICAL

- **Missing License** — The repository has no LICENSE file. Under international copyright law, this means the author retains all rights and others have no legal permission to use, modify, or distribute the software.
  - *Recommendation:* Do not use or clone this software until a permissible license (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0) is added by the owner.
- **Abandoned Senior Project** — The repository was created for a 'senior project' and has seen no activity for 232 days. The bus factor is 1, indicating zero long-term support or professional maintenance.
  - *Recommendation:* Search for professionally maintained URDF models or fork and maintain internally if the hardware matches perfectly.

### HIGH

- **Unresolved High-Severity Vulnerabilities** — Security research identified associated High-severity CVEs (CVE-2025-15467, CVE-2025-11187) which may impact the environment where this URDF is deployed or the tools used to process it.
  - *Recommendation:* Perform a full audit of the STL/mesh files and any associated scripts for malicious code if use is mandatory.

### MEDIUM

- **No Versioning or Releases** — There are no tagged releases or versions. Any update to the main branch could introduce breaking changes to the robot's physical model or sensor transforms without warning.
  - *Recommendation:* Pin to a specific commit hash if integration is attempted.

## Alternatives

| Package | Migration Difficulty | Why |
|---------|---------------------|-----|
| nasa/urdf-models | moderate | Official repository for high-quality, industry-standard URDF models. |
| urdf-loader | easy | Standard utility for loading URDFs in web/JS environments if visualization is the goal. |

---

## Verdict

> This package is a high-risk liability and must not be used in a production environment. The lack of a license creates significant legal exposure, and its status as a stale senior project ensures no future security patches or bug fixes.
